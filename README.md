# Weather Dashboard

## Developer: Josh Lutz

## Description

```
This project is an exercise in pulling third-party API information related to weather information that can
be used to understand what the current weather is for a selected city and render it on a page. The ability to
store a searched city in localStorage will show what recent cities have been searched for and what the 5-day
forecast is.
```

## User Story

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
